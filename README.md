# How to Use
Start a Pomodoro Timer: To start a Pomodoro session, simply type /pomodoro <minutes> in the chat. For instance, if you want to start a 25-minute Pomodoro session, type /pomodoro 25. The bot will acknowledge your request and begin the countdown.

# About the Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals (usually 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This approach aims to improve focus, maintain productivity, and reduce burnout.
