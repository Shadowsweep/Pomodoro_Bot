# Pomodoro_Bot
Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer bot! This Telegram bot is designed to help you implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses timed intervals to improve focus and productivity.

#How to Use
Start a Pomodoro Timer: To start a Pomodoro session, simply type /pomodoro <minutes> in the chat. For instance, if you want to start a 25-minute Pomodoro session, type /pomodoro 25. The bot will acknowledge your request and begin the countdown.

Take a Break: After your Pomodoro session is complete, it's time to take a break. You can initiate a break by typing /breaktime <minutes>. For instance, if you want to take a 5-minute break, type /breaktime 5. The bot will start the break countdown.

Repeat: You can continue alternating between Pomodoro sessions and breaks by repeating the /pomodoro and /breaktime commands as needed.

Features
Flexible Timing: You can set custom durations for both your Pomodoro sessions and breaks. Adjust the <minutes> parameter to tailor the length according to your preferences.

Notifications: The bot will provide notifications at the beginning and end of each Pomodoro session and break, helping you keep track of time without constantly checking.

Easy to Use: The simple command structure makes it straightforward to interact with the bot and get started with your productivity journey.
